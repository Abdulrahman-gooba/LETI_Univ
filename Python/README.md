Learn to use the basic control constructs of the python language. 

The developed algorithm solves the problem as follows:

1) Reads a string and splits it into a list of strings
using the split() string method;

2) If the last item in the list is not a key to what is the meaning of the wordwikipedia.languages() from the wikipedia module, then outputs the
string "no results" and completes the work;

3) Otherwise, sets the found language as
the query language in the current system and removes the list item denoting the language;

4) Finds the maximum length of the list obtained by splitting
page.summary of the current page on the list of rows, outputs this number and
page title;

5) In the cycle from the first to the penultimate element of the list, does the
following: adds the current element to the list-chain; if the next element is not in the list of links from the current page, checks the links leading from the page: 
on each one looks for a link that leads to the next
page from the specified list.When a link is found, adds it to the list of chains and interrupts the cycle;
